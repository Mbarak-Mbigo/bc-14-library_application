Library Application using flask
This is a library application that is supposed to have the following features:

1. A user should be able to sign up/login
2. A user should be able to view all books
3. A user should be able to borrow an available book
4. An administrator should be able to mark a book as returned
5. An administrator should be able to manage all books in the library, that i.e.
6. Create new books,
7. Add quantities and categorize books
8. Delete books from the library or mark a book as unavailable
9. And surchage for lately returned books (Admin puts the fee)


The technology   I used to develop this application are:
Postrgres for Database engine with SQLAlchemy
Flask for the back-end functionalities 
HTML5 and CSS to design the user interface



I was able to implement the following features:
1. *Administrator adding a book
2. *Administrator viewing all books
3. *User viewing all books
4. *User able to sign up and sign in


Due to some constraints I was not able to add the following features:
1
2

4


The application is run by hosting it locally or on the cloud and accessing it 
with the initial/base URL to the application
